##VISTA Experimental control and display toolbox##

This toolbox consists of a set of Matlab routines for controlling the experiment display for vision experiments and managing the interface with the MR, MEG, and ECoG experiments. It was forked from the vistalab/vistadisp, and stripped to the minimum functionality needed for BAIR experiments.
